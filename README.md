# Simple-Kmeans-Clustering-Algorithm

### Abstract
K-means is a centroid-based algorithm, or a distance-based algorithm, where we calculate the distances to assign a point to a cluster. In K-means, each cluster is associated with a centroid. The main objective of the K-Means algorithm is to minimize the sum of distances between the points and their respective cluster centroid. Here is an example of how this algorithm works:
